# WCA ML Lab Demo 
The primary objective of this lab is to provide hands-on experience with the features and
capabilities available to developers in IBM watsonx Code Assistant (WCA) that help to address
data science and machine learning use cases. By completing this lab, you will gain a deeper
understanding of the WCA capabilities and see how it can accelerate machine learning
development.

This lab focuses on a classification use case, involving both structured and unstructured data.
Note that, since the purpose of this hands-on lab is to demonstrate end-to-end ML pipeline using
WCA, this lab focuses on WCA capabilities and general concepts of a typical data science and ML
pipeline – not on data science and ML itself and therefore some phases are not included. For
example, advanced hyperparameter optimization, feature engineering and feature
normalization are not covered in this lab. However, WCA still allows you to complete these steps
if needed.
