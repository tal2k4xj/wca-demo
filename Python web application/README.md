### How to build and run a python flask web application from scratch.

#### Pre-requisites 
1. You have successfully installed and loged in to WCA@IBM extension on VS Code
2. Have Python installed on your system
2. Have basic understanding of Python programming language
    - Difficulty: Beginner

#### How to run this demo
1. Once you have logged in to WCA@IBM, run the below prompts and follow the responses posted by WCA in chat
2. Feel free to edit/add more instructions to the chat.

#### These prompts will guide you on writing your first python flask web application. 
1. For my python project, I want to create a python virtual environment so that I can install all the required packages in it. Suggest me the list of steps to create a new virtual environment while explaining the code.

2. I want to build a flask python web application from scratch. Give me instructions to install the required dependencies for successfully running a flask web application and commands to ensure the dependencies are installed. After satisfying all dependencies, suggest me the all steps required to write a flask web application from scratch, while explaining what each step does along with the code that I can use. Finally, tell me how can I run the flask development server, so that it can run my flask web application.

3. Now that my flask web application is running successfully, I need to package my application so that I can deploy it on a server. Create a python dependency file which tells what are the necessary modules I need to install in order to run the file flaskApp.py successfully.

4. Now I have completed developing my python flask web application. I have built this application in a python virtual environment. Tell me the steps needed to exit this virtual environment while saving everything, and how to ignore the virtual environment files while I push my code to my git repo.

5. How do I commit my changes to my git repo? Suggest me all the steps involved in committing to git with my messages and pushing the files to my git repo.
