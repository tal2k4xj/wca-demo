# WCA Python Demo: Using WCA to Utilize Google Cloud APIs 
In this demo, we will show how to use WCA to develop two Python scripts that utilize Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API and Text-to-Speech API. We will then create a routing script to determine which script to use based on user input. This demo is designed for Python developers who want to leverage WCA to quickly integrate Google Cloud or other 3rd-party CSPs APIs into their applications.
