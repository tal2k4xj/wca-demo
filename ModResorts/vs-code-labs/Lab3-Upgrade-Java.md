### 2. Apply Fixes

For the assisted fixes, you can click the `Instructions` dropdown to see the step which we will guide you. Now we expand the dropdowns of the first issue as shown. There are clear instructions on how to fix this issue at the bottom.

Now we click the name of the file that has issue and needs to be fixed. In the editor window, we select the entire class defined in here that that calls the `MBeanOperationInfo` constructor by highlighting. Then we click `Help me` to ask help from LLM.

Here we change the code in the `DMbeanUtils.java` file using the copy code from chat.

We can ignore the second issue for now as it is a deprecation warning. Or if the rebuild still have error, you can go through the same process and fix the warning as well.


### 3. Rebuild Application

Now that we have all the fixes applied, we can `Rebuild and refresh` to see that there are no more critical issues with the application.
