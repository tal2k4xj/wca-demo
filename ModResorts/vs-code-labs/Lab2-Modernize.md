Now we click the name of the file that has issue and needs to be fixed. In the editor window, we select the entire class defined in here that uses the `ResponseUtils.encodeDataString()` method by highlighting. Then we click `Help me` to ask help from LLM.

The chat with model window will show up and ask model for help. The model gives suggestions for fixing the issue.

There are 2 action items here. 
- First need to change the code in the `UpperServlet.java` file using the copy code from chat.
- Second need to update `pom.xml` to reflect the dependency.

### 3. Rebuild Application

Now that we have all the fixes applied. If your `modresort` application is still running, please stop it by going to `TERMINAL` and `CTRL+C`. You can `Rebuild and refresh` to see that there are no more issues with the application.

We can go to browser to view the new application. This time you will find that the `Logout` button is fixed.
