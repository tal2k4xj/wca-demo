# WCA Financial Services Demo
The primary purpose of this asset is to demonstrate how WCA can effectively augment three adjacent, data oriented personas at Financial Services Firms.

## Data Analyst
Data analyst uses financial data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that inform business decisions. They prepare reports, analyze financial records, and explore investment opportunities, ultimately helping the firm make better choices about risk, strategy, and operations. They often require skills in SQL, and Pythonic libraries like Pandas (data manipulation), Seaborn (visualization) and Matplotlib (visualization).

## Data Scientist
They use data mining, machine learning, and statistical modeling to uncover patterns and insights in financial data. This can involve tasks like fraud detection, risk management, customer analytics or algorithmic trading like displayed in this demo. Data Scientist often have extensive math backgrounds but lack the classic Developer skill set of deploying containerized ML models to inference endpoints.

## ML Op's Engineer
Machine learning (ML) Op's Engineers bridge the gap between data scientists and IT operations, ensuring models are deployed efficiently, perform well in production, and are compliant with regulatory standards.
